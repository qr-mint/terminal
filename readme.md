# Terminal Game API

Documentation: [API Documentation](https://doc.qr-mint.net)

**Terminal Game API** is a project developed by a DAO gaming developer community, providing a convenient API for integrating various payment systems into TMA (Telegram Mini Apps) games and other applications. The platform currently supports payment systems such as Stars, Aeon, and ArcPay (TonConnect), allowing game developers to easily integrate payments without needing to create their own backend.

### Project Features

- **Universal API**: This solution enables developers to integrate payment system support into their projects without the need to develop a backend.
- **Multiple Payment System Support**: Currently, the API supports integration with Stars, Aeon, and ArcPay (TonConnect).
- **Notification System**: The platform provides purchase success notifications, which can be used for dynamic updates or user notifications.
- **Microservice Architecture**: The API is designed for microservice architecture, offering flexibility and scalability. If you need a custom backend for handling unique data, you can also use our API as part of your microservice infrastructure.
- **NFT Minting Integration with QRMint**: Through our partnership with **QRMint**, games can upload and create NFT collections directly on [qr-mint.net](https://qr-mint.net). This allows each game to launch NFT drops and integrate NFT sales into their ecosystem using QRMintâ€™s marketplace.
- **Marketing Support**: By partnering with Terminal Game API, you gain access to marketing support through our own resources and those of our partners, helping to boost visibility and adoption.
- **Authentication**: The API supports issuing access tokens (accessToken) and refresh tokens (refreshToken) for secure and convenient interactions.
- **SDK in Development**: An SDK will soon be available for quick integration.
- **CRM and Admin Panel**: Future plans include a CRM system and an admin panel for managing payment keys and transaction monitoring.

### Using the API

The Terminal Game API is already integrated with our game [@apocalypton_bot](https://t.me/apocalypton_bot), [@QRMint_bot](https://t.me/QRMint_bot), [WEB QRMint](https://qr-mint.net), which will be released soon. This API can be used not only for Telegram Mini Apps but also for other applications requiring payment system integration.

### Benefits

- **No Backend Needed**: Developers can use our solution without the need to create or maintain a backend.
- **Ease of Integration**: The API provides simple methods for configuring and integrating various payment systems.
- **Flexibility and Reliability**: Microservice architecture ensures stability and easy scalability for applications.
- **NFT Marketplace Access**: With QRMint integration, developers can easily manage and sell NFTs within their games, bringing additional engagement and monetization options.

### Future Plans

- Development and release of an SDK for easy integration into various projects.
- Addition of a CRM system and admin panel for flexible management of payment system keys and parameters.
